# EUS Command Line Tool

This repo will contain the code behind the EUS CLI. This command line tool will be primarily used to integrate Github with deployments to our AWS server.

Right now, the development flow is very awkward as it involves running `scp` manually a whole lot. This CLI will make developing websites hosted by the EUS easier.

It is currently under development!

# Usage

To use this CLI, simply run `pip install .` from the root of this repository.

Then, it can be used via the command `eus` in a similar fashion to Git.~
